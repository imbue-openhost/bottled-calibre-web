# Pinned LSIO Calibre-Web image. Tag includes both the upstream Calibre-Web
# release (0.6.26) and LSIO's build number (-ls379), so we get reproducible
# rebuilds rather than chasing `latest`. Bump deliberately when needed.
FROM lscr.io/linuxserver/calibre-web:0.6.26-ls379

# OpenHost bind-mounts the app's persistent data dir at
# /data/app_data/calibre-web inside the container. The LSIO base image
# expects all of Calibre-Web's writable state at /config (declared as
# `VOLUME /config`, which makes the path unwritable during `podman
# build` and forces an anonymous Podman volume on every container
# recreate — exactly what we don't want for a long-lived stateful app).
#
# We can't delete /config in a RUN step because the VOLUME declaration
# overlays it with a tmpfs during the build. We can't remove the
# VOLUME directive from a child image either. The trick: override the
# LSIO init scripts at runtime so Calibre-Web reads/writes
# /data/app_data/calibre-web/config (and /data/app_data/calibre-web/books
# for the library) directly, bypassing /config entirely. The LSIO
# /config tmpfs continues to exist but is never used; everything that
# matters lives under the persistent bind-mount.
#
# This also nicely sidesteps the "/books doesn't exist in the LSIO
# image" issue — we never need that path; the persistent path is
# what calibre-web actually writes to.
#
# See:
#   - root/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/init-calibre-web-config/run
#     (overrides LSIO's init to use the persistent path)
#   - root/etc/s6-overlay/s6-rc.d/svc-calibre-web/run
#     (overrides LSIO's service start to set CALIBRE_DBPATH there)

# Runtime additions on top of the LSIO image:
#
#   python3-pip - needed once during build to populate the auth-venv,
#                 then removed to keep the image lean.
#
# python3 + python3-venv are already installed by LSIO (they ship the
# /lsiopy venv that calibre-web itself runs from). sqlite3 is also
# already present (LSIO uses it in init-calibre-web-config to seed
# kepubify paths).
#
# We install PyJWT (with the cryptography extra for RS256) and requests
# inside a *separate* venv at /opt/auth-venv. We deliberately do not
# touch /lsiopy because (a) we don't want our pinned versions colliding
# with calibre-web's own dependency tree, and (b) some LSIO post-init
# steps reach into /lsiopy expecting upstream-only contents.

# Auth-proxy sidecar. Listens on 0.0.0.0:8080 (the openhost.toml-declared
# port) and forwards to Calibre-Web on 127.0.0.1:8083 with an
# X-Openhost-User: admin header stamped when the request carries a valid
# router-signed owner JWT. See auth_proxy.py for the full rationale.

# An empty Calibre library schema, taken verbatim from upstream Calibre's
# resources/metadata_sqlite.sql. We materialise an empty metadata.db at
# /books on first boot so calibre-web's "DB Location is not Valid" check
# passes and the library configuration step in the wizard is unnecessary.

#
#   init-openhost-calibre-web (oneshot)
#       Runs after init-calibre-web-config (which seeds /config/app.db).
#       Creates the empty Calibre library, patches app.db to point at it
#       and to enable reverse-proxy header login, and randomises the
#       admin password on first boot.
#
#   svc-auth-proxy (longrun)
#       Starts after svc-calibre-web is ready. Runs auth_proxy.py on
#       0.0.0.0:8080.

# The `root/` tree mirrors LSIO's convention so we can drop in service
# definitions without overlay scripting. Each service has a `type` file,
# a `run` script, and `dependencies.d/<dep>` markers; the
# `user/contents.d/<service>` empty files enable each service in the
# generated s6 bundle.
